# HerLand Project

This is a full-stack SPA (Single-Page Application) that aims to shed light on the stories of inspiring women who have not been recognized throughout the history and who have made significant contributions to their respective domains.
The application allows users to filter these figures on specific categories such as sports, science, literature and more.
Happy exploring and learning about them!<br><br>
